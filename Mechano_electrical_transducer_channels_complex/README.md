# Mechano Electrical Transducer (MET) Channel complex

In the absence of 3D-atomic structures of the mammalian MET-channel complex, we constructed a model of the complex by assembling Mus musculus (Mm) TMC1 subunits with MmCIB2 and MmTMIE, adopting
an open-like conformation with domain swapping feature at transmembrane domain 10 (TM10). This model was constructed using AlphaFold2 through the ColabFold github repository. The assembled complex was compared with the cryo-EM structure of the expanded CeTMC-1 complex, confirming that the TM10 domain was in the typical domain-swapped conformation, which is a structural requirement for the proper oligomerization of MmTMC1.

The model was subjected to energy minimization, followed by embedding into a pre-equilibrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) phospholipid membrane and solvation with a final ionic concentration of 15 mM KCl. Subsequently, the system underwent 25 ns of restrained equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (MDs). Here we provide the frame structure at 24 ns post-equilibration of the MET complex.
