This repository contains our 3D-pharmacophores models and the dimeric open-like conformation of the
TMC1 structure modeled using AlphaFold2.


## Overview


## 3D ligand-based pharmacophore models for MET channel block

We used the software Phase to design 3D pharmacophore models representing the main
structural features of known MET channel blockers. These 3D-pharmacophore features were extracted by
assembling a training set consisting of 13 structurally diverse compounds, which included UoS-7692, UoS-
3607, UoS-3606, UoS-5247, UoS-962, Proto-1, E6-berbamine, hexamethyleneamiloride,
amsacrine, phenoxybenzamine, carvedilol-derivate 13, ORC-13661, and FM1-43.
